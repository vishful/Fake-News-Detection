Several assistants stated that in this occasion the holy precinct was suddenly covered in an odd smell “it did not smell as always, it was a familiar smell but I could not relate it to anything, but in my son’s bedroom sometimes smell like that”.
Following the Mass, these altar boys were arrested by the police after confirming that the strange smell was correspond to marijuana, “it was a joke, the idea came during the Christmas Eve mass, we bought no more than half a kilo of Mary Jane and we drop it inside the censer-burner, we are sure that people has left of the Cathedral happier more than ever”.
