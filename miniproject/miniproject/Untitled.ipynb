Naik was quoted as saying that this recovery “validates our age-old practise since thousands of years”. The source of information for the minister was a Bengaluru-based Ayurvedic doctor. In the press briefing, Naik said, “I received a phone call from Dr Isaac Mathai, who runs the Soukya Ayurveda Resort in Bengaluru. He told me that his treatment of Prince Charles through Ayurveda and Homeopathy has been successful. This is just one example of how the system can work”.

He stayed here some months ago; I met him in London last month, but I cannot disclose what I prescribed to him,” Mathai said, adding that he has been prescribing the same medicine against “any viral condition with flu-like symptoms” to thousands of patients, but that he had “not treated a Covid-19 patient as of now”.Asked by HT to comment on whether Prince Charles’s recovery from Covid-19 was aided by advice from an ayurveda practitioner in Bengaluru, a spokesperson for the Prince of Wales in London said: “This information is incorrect. The Prince of Wales followed the medical advice of the National Health Service (NHS) in the UK and nothing more.”', 'On April 2, Naik had told a press conference in Goa, that Prince Charles had been cured of COVID-19 after seeking treatment from a Bengaluru-based alternative treatment resort, SOUKYA International Holistic Health Centre\\' run by a doctor Isaac Mathai.A day after his statement, Clarence House, the official residence of Prince Charles had said that the claim was incorrect, and that the royal \"followed the medical advice of the National Health Service in the UK and nothing more\".

Dr Isaac Mathai has said that Prince Charles is \"a patient of his\" and he would not comment on the issue.', 'Within a day, however, British officials moved to deflate India’s claim, saying that the Prince of Wales had been cured by UK’s National Health Service (NHS). Minister of state for AYUSH Shripad Naik stated at a widely-reported press conference in Goa that Prince Charles got cured of COVID-19 through Ayurveda and homeopathic treatment from an Ayurvedic resort in Bengaluru.
